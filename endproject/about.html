                <h1>What is Phishing?</h1>
        
                <p> Phishing is a type of cybercrime where a person pretending to be a legitimate organisation contacts a target or targets via email, phone, or text message in an attempt to trick them into giving out sensitive information, including passwords, banking and credit card information, and personally identifiable information.

                    The data is then utilised to gain access to your accounts, which may lead to financial loss and identity theft. </p>

                    <h2> 5 common features to spot in regard to phishing! </h2>

                    <p>1. too good to be true:  Wealthy incentives and attention-grabbing headlines are meant to grab people's attention right away. For example, many will tell you that you've won the lottery, an iPhone, or some other expensive prize.</p>
                    <p>2. Sense of urgency: Cybercriminals often use the excuse that the amazing deals are only available for a short period of time, which is one of their favourite strategies. You may even be told by some of them that you have a limited amount of time to reply. It's best to ignore these emails. Sometimes they will also threaten to suspend your account if you don't update your personal information right away. Normally companies typically give customers plenty of notice before cancelling an account.</p>
                    <p>3. Hyperliinks: A link might not be what it seems. When you hover over a link, the URL that appears when you click on it is displayed and that would be the real one where you would be getting redirected to. You always need to look closely as it might look like the real website but it would contain a very subtle spelling mistake. </p>
                    <p>4. Attachments: Avoid opening an email if it contains an attachment that you weren't expecting or just doesn't make sense. These frequently carry viruses or ransomware as payloads. A text file is the only file type that you can and should click on with confidence. </p>
                    <p>5. Unusual Sender: Don't click on anything that seems strange, unexpected, out of character, or just suspicious in general, regardless of whether it appears to be from someone you know</p>

                    
                        <h2>  How to protect yourself from phishing?  </h2>
                        
                        
                        <p> The measures you can take to protect yourself from phishing can be very simple. Other than using technology such as malware scanners such as mine you can also use steps such as adding spam filters inside your email to help push aside the fake emails and keep you safe. This tip may sound self explanatory but staying clear from emailing information that is classed sensitive such as any financial or personal information without being 100% you are sending it to a legitimate reciever. Another tip that can help save you is confirming the validity and reliabilty of the website you want to visit by doing a quick google search or even looking out for the little lock icon that appears next to the url bar which will help in assuring you the website is secure. </p>
